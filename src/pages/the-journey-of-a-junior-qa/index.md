Win and Aloysius discuss their personal journey in becoming Junior Quality Assurance Engineers, touching on the highlights, challenges and perspectives they've experienced coming from a non-QA background.

<!-- end -->

Win and Aloysius recently joined the Engineering team at JustPark as Junior QA Engineers, Aloysius focuses on the mobile device native applications whilst Win works primarily on testing Infrastructure and managing the Engineering team service desk which provides second line support to the business.

## What did you do before becoming a QA?

**Win:** Before I became a Junior QA, I worked in various Customer Support roles at three different companies. My most recent role was as a Senior Customer Happiness Associate at JustPark. Aside from handling enquiries and issues from customers, my responsibilities also included training new starters, managing administrative and payment-related issues and coordinating projects.

**Aloysius:** Before successfully interviewing for the position of a Junior QA here at JustPark, I had spent the past four years at University. This included an undergraduate degree in Business IT for three years followed by a year doing a masters in Software Engineering. My experiences during my undergraduate inspired me to pursue further education as well as a career in the technology industry.               


## Why did you decide to become a QA?

**Win:** Within the first few months of joining JustPark as a Customer Happiness Associate, I was inspired by the work produced by our development team and wanted to learn more about product development and the technical side of the business. Prior to joining the QA team I had assisted bridging the communication gap between the Customer Happiness (CH) and Engineering team by attending various meetings and providing a CH viewpoint. When a Junior QA role opened up, I took this opportunity and, in January, left the CH team to join the QA team. As the saying goes: New Year, New Me. 

**Aloysius:** Like many graduates coming straight out of university I wasn't sure what career path I wanted to take, whether it be a Tester or a Developer. One thing was certain I wanted to be part of a development team. When I spotted this fantastic opportunity as a Junior Mobile QA for a growing start-up that puts a great emphasis on employee development (and offers amazing home-cooked meals every day), it was too good to turn down. The experience I would get working for a company who are leading experts in their field as well as being around a team of QAs and Devs who are always looking to improve and be their best would be invaluable. 

## What did you expect your role to be like?

**Aloysius:** As it was going to be my first role working for a tech company my expectations may differ from Win. For starters, I expected my whole day to be spent making sure the products don’t have any bugs and are working as expected. I thought I would be chasing the devs around trying to get every little bug I find to be fixed immediately. I knew most of my time would be spent focusing on native apps, assisting on the other products JustPark produce when needed. 

**Win:** Prior to my move, my manager had set up meetings with me to discuss what my roles and responsibilities would be. So I knew that part of my day-to-day would consist of managing the internal Service Desk for the Engineering team, with the end goal to take ownership of this entire project. In the other half of my role, I would be the dedicated QA for the Infrastructure Squad and doing tests on tickets related to Site Reliability / Infrastructure. Whilst I have a good knowledge of the JustPark product from working in CH, I wasn't too sure which areas would be specific to the Infrastructure Squad, but, like Aloysius, my underlying expectation was centred around finding and logging bugs. I also knew I'd be attending and getting actively involved in key meetings, both QA specific such as our bug triage, QA planning sessions, and scrum meetings which include sprint planning and retrospectives.

## Has this differed from what you had expected?

**Aloysius:** While my initial thought about the role was that it revolved around just finding and logging bugs, this has changed after spending the first few months as a QA. We have sprint planning meetings where we discuss the plan for the next 2 weeks as well as daily stand-ups in our teams where we discuss what we achieved the day before and what we hope to accomplish today. This gives us a great idea of what’s happening in our team and for us to plan our duties accordingly. Being a QA isn't all about bugs as we are usually the last line of defence before the products gets released to the end user, so it is important to  make sure that the product we are delivering is of as high quality as we can deliver, making sure the users has as easy of an experience using our product as they can.    

**Win:** The Infrastructure Squad was newly created when I joined and is still in the process of coming up to speed, so in the meantime I've also been assisting with the other squads, in particular helping out the Backend and Frontend Squad with testing. The Frontend Squad deal mainly with the UI of the website and several other products so the testing has been very visual and interactive, which was in line with my expectations. As I've never really engaged directly with the Backend of the product before, other than occasionally using SQL in my previous role, I didn't realise that a lot of the testing would involve APIs and running commands. I also hadn't expected for there to be as much planning and preparation as we currently do in meetings. In my past roles, meetings were often very sparse or short so it's been quite a surprise to find so many meetings being booked in to cover various aspects related to a sprint, such as planning and retrospectives. I didn't think I'd be particularly influential in meetings, especially not in the early stages of being in the team anyway, but I feel the Product and Development team do value my knowledge and experience from working in the CH team and it's great to be able to contribute and influence quality in our planning meetings. I've also started learning how to write automated tests - my manager had mentioned previously that there'd be an opportunity to do this but I thought it would take a lot longer before I'd be trusted to get involved in actively contributing to the automation test code base.

## What do you love about QA?

**Win:** I've really loved the opportunity to upskill and the number of new things I've learnt already in such a short space of time. Since I'd been doing Customer Support for such a long time, the core part of the job - answering calls and responding to emails - had become very second nature to me. Whilst there's always a lot to learn about the product/service of the business when joining a new company, I felt I'd begun to outgrow Customer Support roles. With QA, I've developed a lot of knowledge on various tools we use and also started to learn JavaScript, which is used in developing the automated tests. I've been learning to code in HTML and CSS in my own time and making my own website, so everything I've learnt so far in QA has been really helpful and complements well with my own personal development. The development team have also all been super helpful, even when I've bombarded them with a million questions!

**Aloysius:** I have to agree with Ninh when she talks about how much she has learnt in such a short amount of time as its the same for me. QA is such a big subject that there is countless things we learn about and this is what I love and look forward to as a QA. The first few months as a QA for me were mainly learning about the JustPark products, but in the next few months, I will be learning about automation testing which I'm really excited about. This includes Android and IOS automation testing which will involve me learning a new coding language called Swift and continue improving on my Java. 

## What challenges have you encountered?

**Aloysius:** One of the biggest challenges I have faced so far has been learning about the JustPark products and the different features they each have. While my main focus of QA is the native mobile Apps, there will always be instances where I will be needed elsewhere such as the Front-end website. The challenge I came across was trying to remember all the different features of the products and how other parts of the products look like etc. There are still some features of the Android and IOS apps which differ from each other as well. Luckily for me, I have an experienced team around me who are always ready to help and explain to be things I may not be too familiar about. 

**Win:** As I'd been with JustPark as a CH Associate for close to two years prior to joining QA, I had quite a bit more of a head start in terms of product knowledge than Aloysius. Having said that, since I didn't have much Backend knowledge beforehand, my first attempts at testing a ticket for a new API endpoint went quite dramatically wrong. I was struggling to get the API setup correctly and in the process accidentally deleted my SSH key. Luckily some of our developers came to my rescue, but I felt really bad and also frustrated with myself. Going from a role where I was a Senior and the person that everyone in the team used to come to for help and advice, it's been challenging to go into a Junior role where sometimes I simply didn't know what on earth I was doing. Fortunately, the team and my manager in particular have been very supportive and understanding, and I've certainly learnt from my mistakes!


## What advice would you offer to someone thinking of becoming a QA?

**Win:** Read up as much as you can about QA beforehand - there's a lot of really great content on Ministry of Testing. If possible, find out what tools you'll need to use and try to set up beforehand so you can get familiar with how they work. You'll, of course, be taught all of this as part of your training but there's no harm in getting ahead so your first day (or week) runs as smoothly as possible. Also, God forbid, if you're given an SSH key, don't run anything to overwrite it!  

**Aloysius:** As Win has already said there are lots of resources you can find online which can help you get started. Ministry of Testing is a big one which release blog posts which are interesting to read, Ask me Anything sessions where you can ask a fellow QA about questions you may have on the topic presented and even webinars which people host. These are fantastic opportunity to get up to speed with the latest in QA. Most importantly, as for any job you must be prepared to learn and improve yourself.
